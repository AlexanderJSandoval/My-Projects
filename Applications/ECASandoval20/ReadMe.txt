#  Java Card Game using Maven
#	
#  This game was written as a challange given to my by one of my professors. 
#  We had done a basic in class exercise using Maven and he challanged me to 
#  try making a basic card game using it. This is a very rough app, but I'm very 
#  proud that I could make it functional. Though I regret relying on closing the
#  application and using the console for winning results. I would have done all
#  those through Maven if I was doinf the challange again now.
