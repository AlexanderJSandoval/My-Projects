# One of my jobs over the summer was to count the number of kids entering the   
# cafeteria to eat. The school charged teh summer camp based on how many heads 
# we counted so we tried to be as accurate as possible. It could be difficult 
# sometimes because people were also frequently visting the bathrooms. I made
# this program to assist us in getting the most accurate count. We used it too 
# check against our normal count, but it wasn't widely implemented because we
# didn't have the data needed to get it most accurate.
