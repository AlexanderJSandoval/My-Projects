#  Text Rendering App
#	
# This app has a variety of options for how you want the text to show in the 
# results panel and for a simple app, I'm very happy with how it turned out.
#
# This project was one I worked on to get a feel for front end development without
# Scene Builder. Scene Builder is a fantastic tool and I've worked with it quite a 
# bit, but it wanted to make sure I could create an app with a GUI without it as
# well.
